Things that are missing or not yet done:

# traits and education
 - should the victim's personality traits remain or be overwritten with the witch's personality traits?
 - should there be stronger repercussions if the traits oppose?
    - could introduce depressed, paranoid, lunatic etc if the traits don't match or are opposed
 - should the education be overwritten?
    - this would incentivize players to generate a new character with 5* education and never care about their childrens' education... which is kinda the whole point of the new DLC
 - pilgrim looks like a trait that mainly reflects how others perceive the character, should it really be transfered?

# skills
 - should skills be transfered?
    - with "Graceful Aging" (increase skills with age) this could snowball
        - could use 17 as cap
    - maybe skills are more of an expression of the body than the mind?

# ritual
 - include the need for two loyal bodyguard (60+ opinion)
 - give bodyguards perpetual hooks on the victim
 - create secret that the bodyguards know
    - secret should have huge opinion maluses for the entire family
    - give kinslayer?
 - add financial cost for paraphernalia like gems and rare herbs
 - add animal sacrifice, maybe a horse?

# dagger
 - ritual should require a special dagger, shouldn't be unique
 - create questline to acquire dagger
    - start with rumor that can be followed or not (only for witches)
 - enable this for AI could be fun, although witches are rare I guess

# aftermath
 - all these things are beyond my modding capabilities:
 - create memories from past lives that interfer with the present
 - create events where the witch is overwhelmed by all the memories and loss of loved ones
 - create events that show how the witch is out of touch with current developments, technology and even things like current clothing styles
 - increase frequency of bad events with the number of soul travels
 - events to make witch repelled by young lovers/wives because internally the witch is old, reduce fertility
 - character should keep his/her sexual orientation
 - if transferring from male to female or vice versa, add massive downsides
 - more penalties if faith and culture differ?
